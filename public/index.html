			The highest temperature recorded in Britain was in July 2019, 38.7¬∫C at the Botanic
			Gardens in Cambridge. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the
			UK‚Äôs Met Office have announced that there is now a 40% chance of the average
			annual global temperature reaching 1.5¬∫C above pre-industrial levels in at least
			one of the next 5 years. Climate change is here, now.
			Launching the announcement, the WMO General Secretary said: ‚Äúincreasing
			temperatures mean more melting ice, higher sea levels, more heatwaves and
			other extreme weather and greater impacts on food security, health, the
			environment and sustainable development‚Ä¶It underlines the need for climate
			adaptation.‚Äù<br><br>
			There is a strong focus, globally and in the UK, as we approach COP26, on
			emissions reduction and achieving Net Zero. With good reason, reducing emissions
			is critical to reducing our climate change impacts, and is something we must do
			fast if we are to stay close to the Paris commitment of well below 2¬∫C with an
			ambition to limit warming to 1.5¬∫C.
			But Net Zero alone is not enough. Reducing climate impacts requires both
			emissions reduction and adaptation. The UK will face significant further changes in
			climate to 2050 and beyond, even if the world is on a Paris-aligned emissions
			trajectory. By 2050 the heatwave summer of 2018 will be a typical summer, summer
			rainfall could fall by as much as 24% and winter rainfall increase by as much as
			16%, changes that will impact our well-being, the natural environment and the
			economy.<br><br>
			The UK has a strong framework for emissions reduction and planning for climate
			risks set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. But adaptation remains the
			Cinderella of climate change, still sitting in rags by the stove: under-resourced,
			underfunded and often ignored. This Third UK Climate Change Risk Assessment
			(CCRA3) concludes that progress with adaptation policy and implementation is
			not keeping up with the rate of increase in climate risk and that the risks to all
			aspects of life in the UK have increased over the last 5 years.<br><br>
			Without action on adaptation we will struggle to deliver key Government and
			societal goals, including Net Zero itself. We cannot rely on nature to sequester
			carbon unless we ensure that our peat, our trees andour wetlands are healthy, not
			only today but under the climatic conditions we will experience in the future. Our
			advice to Government in this report sets out the risks the UK faces, highlights eight
			priority areas for urgent attention and identifies ten principles for good adaptation
			policy.<br><br>
			COVID-19 has been a tragedy, and it has shown us the importance of preparing
			for known risks. CCRA3 is an assessment of the known risks of climate change, and
			it is time for the UK to respond.
